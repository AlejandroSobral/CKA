## Scheduling Process

For a better understanding, please refer to [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/)

Let's talk about scheduling process. The Kube-scheduler takes care of finding a node to schedule new pods. Nodes are filtered, according to specific requirements that may be set. These are requirements like resource requirements, affinity and anti-affinity, taints and tolerations and more. The scheduler first finds feasible nodes and then scores them. It then picks the node with the highest score. (That's a background process that you don't have to worry about). 
Once this node is found, the scheduler notifies the API server in a process that's called "binding". So once the scheduler decision has been made, it's picked up by the kubelet. And the kubelet will instruct the CRI, which is a container runtime actually, to fetch the image of the required container on the specific node where the pod is going to run. And after fetching the image, the container is created and started.
