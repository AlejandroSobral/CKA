## Taints and Tolerations

Once again, check the [K8s docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) for a better understanding of the topic.

Briefly, Taints applies to node in order to *repel* Pods. The counter part in the Pods is the *Toleration*, that indicates that despite the existance of a taint, it allows to be scheduled in the Node.

Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints.

-------------------------------

### Demo

For this demo there will exist three scenarios. For each one, let's simulate and analyze the results.

- A) There exist 2 Worker Nodes, not taint. A simple deploy with 2 replicas is created.
- B) A worker Node is tainted. A simple deploy is created, similar to the previous one.
- C) The taint remains, and a deploy with Tolerations is created.


Check the existing nodes:
```bash
NAME            STATUS     ROLES           AGE     VERSION
talos-2pv-ytc   Ready      worker          2d4h    v1.32.0
talos-9cm-iu6   Ready      control-plane   3d17h   v1.32.0
talos-pmv-2qi   Ready      worker          3d17h   v1.32.0
```
-----------------------

### Case A

```bash
kubectl create deployment case-a --image=nginx --replicas=2
deployment.apps/case-a created
```

&nbsp;

As expected one Pod per Node is deployed:

```bash
NAME                       READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE           
case-a-5886d95ccc-h7m52     1/1     Running       0          8s    10.244.0.49   talos-pmv-2qi   
case-a-5886d95ccc-xht64     1/1     Running       0          8s    10.244.4.15   talos-2pv-ytc   
```
----------------------------
### Case B
Let's Taint a Node a create a new deployment:

Taint a worker node:
```bash
kubectl taint nodes talos-pmv-2qi taint-b=example:NoSchedule
node/talos-pmv-2qi tainted
```

Check the taint:

```bash
kubectl describe node talos-pmv-2qi | grep Taint
Taints:             taint-b=example:NoSchedule
```

Create the deployment:
```bash
kubectl create deployment case-b --image=nginx --replicas=2
deployment.apps/case-b created
```

Check the pod distribution:

```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE          
case-b-548c598c66-5vwpj   1/1     Running   0          71s   10.244.4.17   talos-2pv-ytc 
case-b-548c598c66-jkrwc   1/1     Running   0          71s   10.244.4.16   talos-2pv-ytc 
```
Once again, the result is the expected.

----------------------------
### Case C

Let's create the Deployment which has the Tolerations:

```bash
kubectl apply -f CaseC-Pod-TolerationDeploy.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
```

Now, the result is the expected once again:
```bash
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE            NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-deployment-9d7779b66-2f6q7   1/1     Running   0          40s   10.244.0.50   talos-pmv-2qi   <none>           <none>
nginx-deployment-9d7779b66-dz5zz   1/1     Running   0          40s   10.244.4.18   talos-2pv-ytc   <none>           <none>
```

----------------------------

### Revert the changes.

```bash
kubectl taint nodes talos-pmv-2qi taint-b=example:NoSchedule-
node/talos-pmv-2qi untainted
```
