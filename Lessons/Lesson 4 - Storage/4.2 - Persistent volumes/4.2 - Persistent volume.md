## Persistent Volumes

PV manifest:
```YAML
kind: PersistentVolume
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv-volume
  labels:
      type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: demo
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mydata"
```

In this context, storageClassName is working as a labeling. Using that, the pod will connect to the PVC will never reach the PV.

Commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f labs/pv.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl get pv
```
```bash
kubectl get pv -o yaml
```
