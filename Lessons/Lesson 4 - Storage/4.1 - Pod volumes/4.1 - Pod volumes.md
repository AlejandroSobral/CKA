## Pod volumes

This command will prompt the required explanation to get each Pod Volume type available:

```bash
kubectl explain pod.spec.volumes | less
```

---------------------------------------------

On this lesson, following file will be used:

```bash
kubectl apply -f morevolumes.yaml
```

From below YAML, the most important part to understand is the reference to:
```YAML
  volumes: 
    - name: test
      emptyDir: {}

```
It states that the most ephemeral volume will be created and linked to the pod, temporarily. 

This storage is used by both containers, producing a shared storage:
```YAML
  containers:
  - name: centos1
    image: centos:7
    command:
      - sleep
      - "3600" 
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /centos1
        name: test
  - name: centos2
    image: centos:7
    command:
      - sleep
      - "3600"
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /centos2
        name: test
```
After applying the morevol.yaml, the pods will run. Check it using:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Or going deeper, a describe command gill provide more details about it:
```bash
kubectl describe pods morevol
```
Now, to check whether the volumes are working as expected, a file can be created at the volume on one container:
```bash
kubectl exec -it morevol -c centos1 -- touch /centos1/centos1file
```

Should the file be there for the other container if the volume is working as expected! 
Check it out!
```bash
kubectl exec -it morevol -c centos2 -- ls /centos2
```
