The following PVC will ask for Storage to the existing PV.

```YAML
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: demo
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f 00-pvc.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl get pvc
```
```bash
kbuectl describe pvc pv-claim
```
Notice that the capacity of the PVC is 2Gi wherears the claim was for 1Gi. The reason?
The PV can't be splitted but to be allocated completely.
```bash
kubectl get pvc,pv
```

Now a node will be deployed, that uses the previous assigned PVC:

```YAML
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
   name: pv-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: pv-claim
  containers:
    - name: pv-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: pv-storage
```

Create a file into the pod
```bash
kubectl exec -it pv-pod -- touch /usr/share/nginx/html/hellothere
```
Check where the pod is running:
```bash
kubectl kubectl get pods pv-pod -o wide
```
kubectl get pods pv-pod -o wide

At worker node, check:
```bash
ls /mydata
```
