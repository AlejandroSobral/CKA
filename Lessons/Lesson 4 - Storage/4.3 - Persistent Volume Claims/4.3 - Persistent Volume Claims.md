The following PVC will ask for Storage to the existing PV.

```YAML
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: demo
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f 00-pvc.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl get pvc
```
```bash
kbuectl describe pvc pv-claim
```
Notice that the capacity of the PVC is 2Gi wherears the claim was for 1Gi. The reason?
The PV can't be splitted but to be allocated completely.
```bash
kubectl get pvc,pv
```
