## ConfigMaps and Secrets

- A ConfigMap is an API resource used to store site-specific data.
- A Secret is a base64 encoded ConfigMap; that's only difference.
- ConfigMap are used to store either environment variables, startup parameters or configuration files.
- When a Configuration File is used in a ConfigMap or Secret, it is mounted as a volume to provide access to its contents. Have in mind that the largest size possible es 1Mb. Beyond that, a PV should be created instead.

## Config Map creation

Create a index.html basic file:
```bash
echo "hello world" > index.html
```
Create a ConfigMap (cm) based of previous created file:
```bash
kubectl create cm webindex --from-file=index.html
```
Describe the recently created resource:
```bash
kubectl describe cm webindex
```
Create a deployment for the webserver:
```bash
kubectl create deployment webserver --image=nginx
```
Set manually following configuration by using:
```bash
kubectl edit deployments.apps webserver
```

```YAML
spec.template.spec
volumes:
- name: cmvol
  configMap:
    name: webindex

spec.template.spec.containers
volumeMounts:
- mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  name: cmvol
```

Check the resources:

```bash
kubectl get deploy
```
Check the corresponding Pod:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

```bash
kubectl exec webserver-xxx-yyy -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

Output will show the content of index.html:

```bash
kubectl exec pods/webserver-865c5fcbf4-c86cg -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
hello world
```
