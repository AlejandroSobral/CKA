## 10.6 - Create K8s User Accounts.

Having into consideration that users do not exist as such in kuberenets, but as authorized certificated completed with some authorization as defined in the RBAC, let's analyze the process to create one.

It can be resumed as the following:
- Create a Public/Private Key Pair
- Create a Certificate Signing Request
- Sign the Certificate
- Create a Configuration file that uses that key to acces K8s cluster
- Create a RBAC Role pointing to the same name defined previously
- Create a RBAC role binding

--------------------------------------------

### Demo

Create namespaces and get contexts:
```bash
kubectl create ns students
namespace/students created

kubectl create ns staff
namespace/staff created

kubectl config get-contexts


CURRENT   NAME                          CLUSTER      AUTHINFO           NAMESPACE
*         kubernetes-admin@kubernetes   kubernetes   kubernetes-admin
```
It shows the only context available, admin. 

This information came from ~/.kube/config, the configuration file.

Important fields to remark are:
- client-certifica-data: Public key certificate signed by the Certificate Authority that belongs to this Cluster.
- client-key-data: Private key certificate

&nbsp;

At the end of this demo, this file will contain:
```bash
users:
- name: anna
  user:
    client-certificate: anna.crt # Public key certificate signed by the Certificate Authority that belongs to this Cluster.
    client-key: anna.key # Private key certificate
```
&nbsp;


Let's start with the steps:
Generates a 2048-bit RSA private key and saves it to anna.key. This key will be used to authenticate the user "anna":
```bash
openssl genrsa -out anna.key 2048
```
&nbsp;


Creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) named anna.csr.
-subj "/CN=anna/O=k8s" specifies the subject of the certificate. CN=anna sets the Common Name to "anna" (which will be the user's name), and O=k8s sets the Organization to "k8s".

```bash
openssl req -new -key anna.key -out anna.csr -subj "/CN=anna/O=k8s"
```
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- Signs the CSR using the Kubernetes Certificate Authority (CA) for this to be useful:
   - /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt and /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key are the CA certificate and private key, respectively.
   - -CAcreateserial creates a serial file that helps tracking the certificate serial numbers.
   - -out anna.crt saves the signed certificate to anna.crt.
   - -days 1800 sets the certificate's validity to 1800 days.
- This commands requires Sudo since the ca.key file is involve, and that is the private key for K8s cluster.

```bash
sudo openssl x509 -req -in anna.csr -CA /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -CAkey /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out anna.crt -days 1800
```
&nbsp;

This output confirms that the certificate signing request was created correctly.
```bash
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=CN = anna, O = k8s
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Adds the user "anna" to the kubectl configuration, associating the generated certificate and key with the user.
```bash
kubectl config set-credentials anna --client-certificate=anna.crt --client-key=anna.key
User "anna" set.
```
From now on, the kube config file will included all the parameters that were highligted before.

&nbsp;

Creates a new context named anna-context that uses the "anna" user, connects to the "kubernetes" cluster, and sets the default namespace to "staff"
```bash
kubectl config set-context anna-context --cluster=kubernetes --namespace=staff --user=anna
Context "anna-context" created.

kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                          CLUSTER      AUTHINFO           NAMESPACE
          anna-context                  kubernetes   anna               staff
*         kubernetes-admin@kubernetes   kubernetes   kubernetes-admin
```




Switches the current kubectl context to anna-context, so all subsequent kubectl commands will use this context.
```bash
kubectl config use-context anna-context
Switched to context "anna-context"
```
&nbsp;


Now list the Pods, for example:

```bash
kubectl get pods 
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "anna" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "staff"
```
This error is expected. The user "anna" has been authenticated, but she hasn't been granted any permissions to access resources in the "staff" namespace. This is the default security behavior in Kubernetes.

&nbsp;

Switches back to the administrator context to create the necessary RBAC resources.
Creates a Role named "staff" in the "staff" namespace. This Role defines the permissions that will be granted.
Creates a RoleBinding named "staff-role-binding" in the "staff" namespace. This RoleBinding binds the "staff" Role to the user "anna", granting her the specified permissions.
Switches back to the anna context.
```bash
kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
kubectl apply -f staff-role.yaml
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/staff created
```

&nbsp;

As you can see below, this file will grant many 'verbs' permissions for role "Staff".

staff-role.yaml
```YAML
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: staff
  name: staff
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"]
  resources: ["deployments", "replicasets", "pods"]
  verbs: ["list", "get", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```



```bash
kubectl apply -f rolebind.yaml
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/staff-role-binding created
```

Now, this will bind the Role staff to user "anna":

```YAML
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: staff-role-binding
  namespace: staff
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: anna
  apiGroup: ""
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: staff
  apiGroup: ""
```

&nbsp;


Now, "anna" can create a Deployment in the "staff" namespace, as she has the necessary permissions.


```bash
kubectl config use-context anna-context
Switched to context "anna-context".
```
&nbsp;

Also create a deployment:
```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
deployment.apps/nginx created
```

&nbsp;

"anna" can now list the pods in the "staff" namespace, confirming that the RBAC configuration is working correctly.
```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-5869d7778c-7rhgc   1/1     Running   0          7s
```

&nbsp;

 And that's it!
