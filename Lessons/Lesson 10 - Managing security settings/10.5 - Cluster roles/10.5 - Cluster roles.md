## 10.5 - Cluster roles

[Clusterroles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) are a very alike concept as Roles but Cluster-wide.

ClusterRoles have several uses. You can use a ClusterRole to:

- Define permissions on namespaced resources and be granted access within individual namespace(s)
- Define permissions on namespaced resources and be granted access across all namespaces
- Define permissions on cluster-scoped resources

## Demo

Let's check some of the existing Cluster roles that are defined by default:

(kubectl is now kbc, since I'm using an Alias).

```bash
kbc get clusterroles

NAME                                                                   CREATED AT
admin                                                                  2025-01-21T22:28:10Z
cluster-admin                                                          2025-01-21T22:28:10Z
edit                                                                   2025-01-21T22:28:10Z
flannel                                                                2025-01-21T22:28:40Z
system:aggregate-to-admin                                              2025-01-21T22:28:10Z
system:aggregate-to-edit                                               2025-01-21T22:28:10Z
system:aggregate-to-view                                               2025-01-21T22:28:10Z
system:auth-delegator                                                  2025-01-21T22:28:10Z
system:basic-user                                                      2025-01-21T22:28:10Z
```

Check now the YAML output of the command, being aware that this shouldn't be edited:
```bash
kbc edit clusterroles -o yaml
```

&nbsp;

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
items:
- aggregationRule:
    clusterRoleSelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    annotations:
      rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
    creationTimestamp: "2025-01-21T22:28:10Z"
    labels:
      kubernetes.io/bootstrapping: rbac-defaults
    name: admin
    resourceVersion: "280"
    uid: 34f03a36-f100-4a6c-a88e-eb5a4688090f
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    resources:
    - pods/attach
    - pods/exec
    - pods/portforward
    - pods/proxy
    - secrets
    - services/proxy
    verbs:
    - get
    - list
    - watch
```

As you might imagine, it looks pretty similar than Roles; but Cluster-wide.
