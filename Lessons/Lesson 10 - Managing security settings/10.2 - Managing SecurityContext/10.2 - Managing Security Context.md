## 10.2 - Managing Security Context

Check the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

SecurityContext defines privilege and access control settings for Pods and containers. Of course, those can overlap. It can be specified whether a Pod has Root permissions.

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 1000
    fsGroup: 2000
    supplementalGroups: [4000]
  volumes:
  - name: securevol
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:
  - name: sec-demo
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: securevol
      mountPath: /data/demo
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```
In the configuration file, the runAsUser field specifies that for any Containers in the Pod, all processes run with user ID 1000. The runAsGroup field specifies the primary group ID of 3000 for all processes within any containers of the Pod. If this field is omitted, the primary group ID of the containers will be root(0). Any files created will also be owned by user 1000 and group 3000 when runAsGroup is specified. Since fsGroup field is specified, all processes of the container are also part of the supplementary group ID 2000. The owner for volume /data/demo and any files created in that volume will be Group ID 2000. Additionally, when the supplementalGroups field is specified, all processes of the container are also part of the specified groups. If this field is omitted, it means empty.

## Demo

Apply the security-context:
```bash
:~/ckas kubectl apply -f security-context.yaml
pod/security-context-demo created

:~/ckas kubectl get pods security-context-demo
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
security-context-demo    1/1     Running   0          7s
```

&nbsp;

Connect to the Pod and check:
```bash
:~/ckas kubectl exec -it security-context-demo -- sh
/ $ ps
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 1000      0:00 sleep 3600
    7 1000      0:00 sh
   13 1000      0:00 ps
```
Ps is showing the user. UserID is set to 1000 as specified in the SecurityContext.

Check the data directory, check the fsGroup:
```bash
/ $ cd /data
/data $ ls
demo
/data $ ls -l
total 4
drwxrwsrwx    2 root     2000   6 Feb 20 21:58 demo
```

Use the id command to see uid and gid:
```bash
/data $ id
uid=1000 gid=1000 groups=1000,2000,4000
```

Now, should a file got created, who will own it?
```bash
/data $ cd demo/
/data/demo $ touch abc
/data/demo $ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--    1 1000     2000   0 Feb 20 21:59 abc
/data/demo $ exit
```

As expected, it is own accordingly.
