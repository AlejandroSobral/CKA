## 10.3 - ServiceAccounts

Check [Authenticating docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/).

- The Kubernetes API doesn't define users for people to authenticate and authorize
 - Users are obtained externally
 - Defined by X.509 certificates
- Obtained from external OpenID-based authentication (Google, AD and many more)
- ServiceAccounts are used to authorize Pods to get access to specific API resources

&nbsp;

Existing ServiceAccounts can be checked:
```bash
kubectl get sa
NAME      SECRETS   AGE
default   0         29d
```
&nbsp;

Moreover, to get the full list of serviceAccount, the command will be:
```bash
kubectl get sa -A
```

&nbsp;

As all Pods uses a serviceAccount, it can be easily check by doing:
```bash
kubectl get pods security-context-demo -o yaml | grep serviceAccount
  serviceAccount: default
  serviceAccountName: default
      - serviceAccountToken:
```
