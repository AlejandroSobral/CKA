## 10.1 - Understanding API Access

KubeAPI is the resource that have access into etcd. The connection between etcd and kube-api includes rules and cluster roles. The communication between them depends upon this. The diagram contains two flows, the one on top is for *kubectl*, the client utility; which configures resides at .kube/config. What does it contain?
PKI certificates. That's actually what it is consider a "user", a signed PKI certificate.
The second case on which kube-api needs to be accessed, from applications. For example, Pod which needs to get information out from API server. For that, the default resource is the ServiceAccount. This will be like a user, but for usage by the pod only. 
Whether one or the order are trying to make changes into etcd, they need a role or a cluster role. For this to get accomplished, there exist the "Role binding" or the "ClusterRoleBinding", depending upon the requirement. As a result, on one side the serviceAccount or the user, and in the other the role that will be used. The binding will be, of course, right in the middle.
