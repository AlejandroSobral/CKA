## Kubernetes Monitoring

The Metric Server exposes an API that can expose custom metrics. Then it can be used by HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) and VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler). 

Check its [Documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server).
It also provides a 'kubectl top' interface to provide usage information.

### Metric Server Installation

It is worth mentioning that the installaton is required, due to the fact of Metric Server not being included in Vanilla Kubernetes pack.

Of course, first of all, this service should be installed. [Official installation guide](Documentation.

To install the latest Metrics Server release from the components.yaml manifest, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```
&nbsp;


Output should come like:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
serviceaccount/metrics-server created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:aggregated-metrics-reader created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server-auth-reader created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server:system:auth-delegator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created
service/metrics-server created
deployment.apps/metrics-server created
apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io created
```
&nbsp;

Check existing system pods:
```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get pods
```

Output will show something like the following:
```bash
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
calico-kube-controllers-7f764f4f68-9hmpd   1/1     Running   11 (19h ago)   62d
.
. (deleted entries in here)
.
metrics-server-54bf7cdd6-f7gnl             0/1     Running   0              97s
```
&nbsp;

Some issue is ongoing with the Pods, since metrics-server is showing 0/1 running. Let's investigate:

```bash
kubectl logs -n kube-system metrics-server-54bf7cdd6-f7gnl
```

&nbsp;

There exist an issue the TLS certificate:

```bash
E1221 16:32:10.601134       1 scraper.go:149] "Failed to scrape node" err="Get \"https://192.168.1.15:10250/metrics/resource\": tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: cannot validate certificate for 192.168.1.15 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs" node="controlnode"
```

&nbsp;

Since this is out of the scope of this part of the course, we will just disable this checking so far:

Add the following line into **spec.template.spec.containers.args**

```bash
    - --kubelet-insecure-tls
```

The result will look like:

```bash
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - --cert-dir=/tmp
        - --secure-port=10250
        - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname
        - --kubelet-use-node-status-port
        - --metric-resolution=15s
        - --kubelet-insecure-tls
```

After this manual "fix", the result will be:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get pods
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
calico-kube-controllers-7f764f4f68-9hmpd   1/1     Running   11 (20h ago)   62d
.
.
.
metrics-server-587b667b55-s2zcs            1/1     Running   0              2m17s
```

&nbsp;

Once this has been fixed, top command will be available:

```bash
alesb@ControlNode:~$ kubectl top nodes
NAME          CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%   
controlnode   387m         9%     3379Mi          11%       
workernode    60m          3%     2240Mi          28%       
workernode2   81m          4%     2396Mi          30% 


alesb@ControlNode:~$ kubectl top pods
NAME                CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)   
mypod-workernode2   0m           2Mi  
```
