## Upgrade Node Cluster

Even if there might not existe any better page to follow this matter up than the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/), we will explain each step. How to upgrade kubeadm, kubectl, and kubelet.

Consider that skipping MINOR versions when upgrading is unsupported.

&nbsp;
----------------------------
### Procedure begins

Despite the documentation being very helpful and clear, I'd set in here all the outputs to use as a complementary guide as reference:


Determine which version to upgrade to:

```bash 
kubeadm version | grep GitVersion
kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"31", GitVersion:"v1.31.1", GitCommit:"948afe5ca072329a73c8e79ed5938717a5cb3d21", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2024-09-11T21:26:49Z", GoVersion:"go1.22.6", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```
&nbsp;

```bash 
sudo apt-cache madison kubeadm
   kubeadm | 1.32.0-1.1 | https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb  Packages
```
&nbsp;

### Upgrading control plane nodes

Upgrade kubeadm:
```bash
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm='1.32.0-1.1*' && \
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
```
&nbsp;

Summarize expected output:

```bash
...
...
Selected version '1.32.0-1.1' (isv:kubernetes:core:stable:v1.32:pkgs.k8s.io [amd64]) for 'kubeadm'
The following packages will be upgraded:
  kubeadm
1 to upgrade, 0 to newly install, 0 to remove and 54 not to upgrade.
Need to get 12.2 MB of archives.
After this operation, 12.7 MB of additional disk space will be used.
Get:1 https://prod-cdn.packages.k8s.io/repositories/isv:/kubernetes:/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb  kubeadm 1.32.0-1.1 [12.2 MB]

```
&nbsp;

Verify it worked as expected:
```bash
kubeadm version

kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"32", GitVersion:"v1.32.0", GitCommit:"70d3cc986aa8221cd1dfb1121852688902d3bf53", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2024-12-11T18:04:20Z", GoVersion:"go1.23.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```
&nbsp;

Verify the upgrade plan:
```bash
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks.

[upgrade] Fetching available versions to upgrade to
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: 1.31.1
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.32.0
[upgrade/versions] Target version: v1.32.0
[upgrade/versions] Latest version in the v1.31 series: v1.31.4

Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   NODE          CURRENT   TARGET
kubelet     controlnode   v1.31.1   v1.31.4
kubelet     workernode    v1.31.1   v1.31.4
kubelet     workernode2   v1.31.1   v1.31.4

Upgrade to the latest version in the v1.31 series:

COMPONENT                 NODE          CURRENT    TARGET
kube-apiserver            controlnode   v1.31.1    v1.31.4

etcd                      controlnode   3.5.15-0   3.5.16-0

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

	kubeadm upgrade apply v1.31.4

The table below shows the current state of component configs as understood by this version of kubeadm.
Configs that have a "yes" mark in the "MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED" column require manual config upgrade or
resetting to kubeadm defaults before a successful upgrade can be performed. The version to manually
upgrade to is denoted in the "PREFERRED VERSION" column.

API GROUP                 CURRENT VERSION   PREFERRED VERSION   MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED
kubeproxy.config.k8s.io   v1alpha1          v1alpha1            no
