## Question 2: Scheduling a Pod
Schedule a Pod with the name lab123 that runs the Nginx and redis applications.

------------------------------------

### Demo

Use the following command to get a template to start with:
```bash
kubectl run pods --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > q2.yaml
```
&nbsp;

Following YAML will be generated. It would require some modifications.
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: pods
  name: pods
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: pods
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```
&nbsp;

Include the Redis Container:
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: pods
  name: pods
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: pods
    resources: {}
  - image: redis
    name: redis
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```
&nbsp;

Apply the new yaml:
```bash
kubectl apply q2-pods.yaml
pod/lab123 created
```
&nbsp;

Create the resource and verify its working:
```bash
kubectl apply q2-pods.yaml
pod/lab123 created

kubectl get pods
NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
lab123   2/2     Running   0          9m34s


kubectl describe pods lab123

Events:

```

That's it!
