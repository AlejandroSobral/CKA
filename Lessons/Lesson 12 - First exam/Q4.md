## Question 4: Setting up Persistent Storage
Create a Persistent Volume with the name lab123 that uses HostPath on the directory /lab125.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


```YAML
# This manifest mounts /data/foo on the host as /foo inside the
# single container that runs within the hostpath-example-linux Pod.
#
# The mount into the container is read-only.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: lab125-hostpath
spec:
  containers:
  - name: alpine
    image: alpine:latest
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /lab125
      name: lab125
  volumes:
  - name: lab125
    # mount /lab125, but only if that directory already exists
    hostPath:
      path: /home/worker/lab125/ # directory location on host
      type: DirectoryOrCreate # this field is optional
```
