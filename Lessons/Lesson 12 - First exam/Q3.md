## Question 3: Managing Application Initialization
Create a deployment with the name lab1234deploy which runs the Nginx image, but waits 30 seconds before starting the actual Pods.

-------------------------------------------------------------

kubectl create deployment lab124deploy --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml >> lab124deploy.yaml


Original:
```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: lab124deploy
  name: lab124deploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: lab124deploy
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: lab124deploy
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
status: {}
```

Modified:
```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: lab124deploy
  name: lab124deploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: lab124deploy
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: lab124deploy
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
      initContainers:
      - name: init-delay
        image: busybox:latest
        command: ["sleep", "30"]
status: {}
```

&nbsp;

Let's proceed with deploy creation a then, let's verify its working:
```bash
kubectl apply -f lab124deploy.yaml
deployment.apps/lab1234deploy created

kubectl get pods
NAME                             READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
lab1234deploy-5f9d645f9c-gzrjn   0/1     Init:0/1   0          4s

kubectl get pods
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
lab1234deploy-5f9d645f9c-gzrjn   1/1     Running   0          85s
```
So far, the "Init" status allow us to affirm that the busybox initContainer was successfully deployed.

&nbsp;

By describing the pod, it will be clear that once the "init-delay" started, 30 seconds occured before pulling nginx image.
```bash
kubectl describe pod lab1234deploy-5f9d645f9c-gzrjn

And that's it!
