## Question 8: Creating a Static Pod
Configure a Pod with the name lab129pod that will be started by the kubelet on node worker2 as a static Pod.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Taking this [Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/static-pod/) as base:



```bash
ssh worker2
```

&nbsp;

Let's create a YAML Pod file:
```bash
kubectl run static-pod --image=nginx  --port=80 --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: static-pod
  name: lab129pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: static-pod
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

&nbsp;

Move the file to the path indicates in here:
```bash
cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml | grep staticPodPath
staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests

sudo cp static-pod.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
```

&nbsp;

Check the Pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
lab129pod-workernode   1/1     Running   0          24s
```
&nbsp;

Now delete the YAML:
```bash
sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/manifests/static-pod.yaml

kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
```

&nbsp;

And that's it!
