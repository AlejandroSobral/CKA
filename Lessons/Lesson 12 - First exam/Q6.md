## Question 6: Securing Network Traffic
Create a Namespace with the name restricted, and configure it such that it only allows access to Pods exposing port 80 for Pods coming from the Namespaces access.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#behavior-of-to-and-from-selectors)

In particular:

```bash
namespaceSelector: This selects particular namespaces for which all Pods should be allowed as ingress sources or egress destinations.
```


Set both namespaces and some Pods to test this out:
```bash
kubectl create namespace restricted

kubectl run pod-restricted -n restricted --image=nginx --port=80 --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: pod-restricted
  name: pod-restricted
  namespace: restricted
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: pod-restricted
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

```bash
kubectl get pods -n restricted
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod-restricted   1/1     Running   0          10s
```

```bash
kubectl create namespace access
kubectl run pod-access -n access --image=alpine --port=80 --dry-run=client -o yaml
```
Set the sleep command of container will fail:
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: pod-access
  name: pod-access
  namespace: access
spec:
  containers:
  - image: alpine
    name: pod-access
    command:
    - "sleep"
    - "3600"
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

```bash
kubectl get pods -n access
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod-access   1/1     Running   0          81s

kubectl get pods -n restricted
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod-restricted   1/1     Running   0          10m
```

Set Pods in the default namespace, that should not have access to resources in restricted, after applying the Network Policy.
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: pod-def
  name: pod-def
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - image: alpine
    name: pod-def
    command:
    - "sleep"
    - "3600"
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

```bash
kubectl describe pods -n restricted | grep ' IP: '
  IP:  172.16.190.212
```

From any host in the network, it replies back:
```bash
curl 172.16.190.212

...
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>
...
```


Moving forward, it should be reachable only from Pods coming from namespace access.
```bash
kubectl create networkpolicy --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

[Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#targeting-multiple-namespaces-by-label):

```YAML
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: ingress-to-restricted
  namespace: restricted
spec:
  # Selects all Pods in the 'restricted' namespace.
  # If you want to limit this policy to specific Pods, define label selectors here.
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress  # Defines the policy as an 'Ingress' type, meaning it controls incoming traffic to the selected Pods.
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: access  # This allows traffic only from Pods in the 'access' namespace by matching its metadata label.
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP  # Specifies the protocol for allowed traffic (TCP in this case).
          port: 80  # Restricts allowed traffic to port 80, commonly used for HTTP communication.
```

Apply the NetworkPolicy, and test it out on the Pods.
It might required to install Curl. -- **apk add curl**
 &nbsp;

Check now if it works from the Pods in the Default Namespace:
```bash
kubectl exec pod-def -it -- sh
/ # curl 172.16.190.217
curl: (28) Failed to connect to 172.16.190.217 port 80 after 134176 ms: Could not connect to server
```

&nbsp;

Check now if it works from the Pods in the Access Namespace:
```bash
kubectl exec pod-access -it -n access -- sh
/ # curl 172.16.190.217
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>
...
```

Working!
