## Question 5: Configuring Application Access
Create a Deployment with the name lab126deploy, running 3 instances of the Nginx image.
Configure it such that it can be accessed by external users on port 32567 on each cluster node.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Demo - What will be required for this?

&nbsp;

First of all, a simple deployment.

```bash
kubectl create deployment lab126deploy --image=nginx --replicas=3 --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

&nbsp;

Get the template deployment YAML:
```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: lab126deploy
  name: lab126deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: lab126deploy
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: lab126deploy
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources: {}
status: {}
```

&nbsp;

Modify the template:
```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: lab126deploy
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

&nbsp;

Second step. Create a service, to be able to reach the deployment Pods.
In particular, a "[nodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport)"; Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort).

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: lab126deploy
spec:
  type: NodePort #This means the Service exposes a port on every node in the cluster.
  selector:
    app: nginx # This Service will route traffic to Pods that have the label app: nginx.
  ports:
    - port: 80          # The Service is accessible on port 80 inside the cluster
      targetPort: 80    # The traffic is forwarded to the nginx Pods' port 80
      nodePort: 32567   # The service is exposed on port 32567 of every node.
```
