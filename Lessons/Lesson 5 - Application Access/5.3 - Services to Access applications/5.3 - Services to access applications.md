## 5.3 Using Services to Access Applications

### Understanding Services

- Service resources are used to provide access to Pods.
- if multiple Pods are used a Service endpoint, the Service will load balance traffic to the Pods.
- Different types of Service can be configured.
  - **ClusterIP**: the Service is internally exposed and is reachable only from within the cluster.
  - **NodePort**: the Service is exposed at each node's Ip address as a port. The Service can be reached from outside the cluster at nodeip:nodeport
  - **LoadBalancer**: the cloud provider offers a load balancer that routes traffic to either NodePort or ClusterIP-based Services.
  - **ExternalName**: the Service is mapped to an external name that is implemented as a DNS CNAME record

### Configuring services

- kubectl expose:
  - Looks up a deployment, service, replica set, replication controller or pod by name and uses the selector for that resource as the selector for a new service on the specified port

- kubectl create service
  - Create a service using a specified subcommand.

### Demo
```bash
kubectl create deploy webshop --image=nginx --replicas=3
```
```bash
kubectl get pods --selector app=webshop -o wide
```
```bash
kubectl expose deploy webshop --type=NodePort --port=80
```
```bash
kubectl describe svc webshop
```
```bash
kubectl get svc
```
```bash
curl nodeip:nodeport
```
