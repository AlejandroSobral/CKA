## Service - Ingress

What is Ingress?

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

Here is a simple example where an Ingress sends all its traffic to one Service:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  client([client])-. Ingress-managed <br> load balancer .->ingress[Ingress];
  ingress-->|routing rule|service[Service];
  subgraph cluster
  ingress;
  service-->pod1[Pod];
  service-->pod2[Pod];
  end
  classDef plain fill:#ddd,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#000;
  classDef k8s fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#fff;
  classDef cluster fill:#fff,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#326ce5;
  class ingress,service,pod1,pod2 k8s;
  class client plain;
  class cluster cluster;
  ```

## Installation procedure

Since Kubernetes by default have no Ingress, it needs to be install. Follow the below posted procedure:

```bash
helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
```

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```
Expected output:
```js
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ingress-nginx-controller-cbcf8bf58-dtv96   1/1     Running   0          5m14s
```

Create the deployment:
```bash
kubectl create deploy nginxsvc --image=nginx --port=80
```

Create the Service to expose the deployment (By creating a ClusterIP):
```bash
kubectl expose deploy nginxsvc
```

Get all which matches the selector:
```bash
kubectl get all --selector app=nginxsvc
```

The expected output should look like:
```js
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/nginxsvc-7f8cdcb4db-psvtx   1/1     Running   0          57s

NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/nginxsvc   ClusterIP   10.105.55.3   <none>        80/TCP    5s

NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/nginxsvc   1/1     1            1           57s

NAME                                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/nginxsvc-7f8cdcb4db   1         1         1       57s
```

Continue with the Service creation:

```bash
kubectl create ingress nginxsvc --class=nginx --rule=nginxsvc.info/*=nginxsvc:80
```

The important part is in the rule. And the rule is matching, nginxsvc.info/*, any path on nginxsvc.info. 
And it is forwarding that to nginx, as we see, :80. That's a service resource that we created before.

To make it work on local env the port forwarding is required as below:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n ingress-nginx svc/ingress-nginx-controller 8080:80
```

As well as the 'fake' DNS:

```bash
sudo echo "127.0.0.1 nginxsvc.info" >> /etc/hosts
```

Therefore, should everything been set correctly, this will reply:

```bash
curl nginxsvc.info:8080
```

Had the answer to be the nginx home, it will mean that the Ingress is connected to the Service and the Service is connected to the Pod. Well done!
