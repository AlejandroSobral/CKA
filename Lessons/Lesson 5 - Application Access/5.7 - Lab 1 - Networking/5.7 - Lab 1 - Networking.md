## 5.7 Lab: Managing Networking

What to do:
- Run a Deployment with the name 'apples', using 3 replicas and the Ngnix image
- Expose the deplyment in such a way that is accesible on my.fruit
- Use port fordwarding to test



First step:

kubectl create deploy -h | less

To run the deployment, we can execute:

```bash
kubectl create deployment apples --image=nginx --replicas=3 
```
- Image matching ngnix
- Replicas set as 3
- Port on usage is 80

```bash
kubectl expose deploy apples --port=80
```
- Create the associated service:

```bash
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service/apples   ClusterIP   10.104.253.124   <none>        80/TCP         64s
```

Include this line on top of /etc/hosts:
```bash
sudo nano '/etc/hosts' && sudo sh -c 'echo "localhost my.fruit" | cat - /etc/hosts > /tmp/hosts_temp && mv /tmp/hosts_temp /etc/hosts'
```

Get Pods names for Port-forwarding:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Expected output:
``` bash
NAME                         READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
pod/apples-57d74d847b-pghjz   1/1     Running       0          48m
pod/apples-57d74d847b-rwwtb   1/1     Running       0          48m
pod/apples-57d74d847b-xmgqp   1/1     Running       0          48m
```


Create an ingress to expose externally the service that the expose created:
```bash
kubectl create ingress apples-ingress --class=nginx --rule=my.fruit/*=apples:80
```
As per the instruction, all incoming traffic matching my.fruit/ should go to deployment called "apples" at Port 80.

Lasty, set the port-forwarding and curl the URL 'my.fruit':
```bash
kubectl port-forward pods/apples-57d74d847b-xmgqp 1234:80
```
Consider that this shouldn't be interrupted or it will fail.

```bash
curl my.fruit:1234
```


Output should come like:

```html
