## 9.5 Lab

This Lab have the following objectives:

- Run a webserver with the name lab9server in Namespace "restricted", using the Nginx image and ensure it is exposed by a Service
- In the default Namesapce start two Pods: sleepybox1 and sleepybox2, each based on the Busybox image using the sleep 3600 command as the command
- Create a NetworkPolicy that limits Ingress traffic to restricted, in such a way that only the sleepybox1 Pod from the default Namespace has access and all other access is forbidden

```bash
kubectl apply -f restricted.yaml

namespace/restricted created
pod/lab9-nginx created
service/lab9-nginx-service created

kubectl apply -f sleepy-boxes.yaml
pod/sleepybox1 created
pod/sleepybox2 created

kubectl exec -it sleepybox1 -n default -- wget --spider --timeout=1 lab9-nginx-service.restricted.svc.cluster.local
Connecting to lab9-nginx-service.restricted.svc.cluster.local (10.96.187.74:80)
remote file exists

kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-from-default-busybox1 created
