## 9.1 Networking basics.

To understand what CNI (Container Network Interface) is, nothing better that its own [CNI Docs](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni). Anyway, it consists of specifications to develop network plugins in Linux containers.

Since I'm working with Talos, [Flannel](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel) is used for this purpose as a plugin.

```bash
kubectl get all -n kube-system | grep flannel

pod/kube-flannel-62xbw                      1/1     Running   4 (18d ago)    20d
pod/kube-flannel-7vmfh                      1/1     Running   12 (11m ago)   22d
pod/kube-flannel-vs49v                      1/1     Running   10 (11m ago)   20d
pod/kube-flannel-z7dlk                      1/1     Running   17 (11m ago)   22d
```

Flannel is a simple and lightweight Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that provides networking for Kubernetes clusters. It uses an overlay network to connect pods across nodes.

You can now do the same in your own cluster and find out who is taking care of this. It is likely to be Calico!.
