## 11.2 Troubleshooting Flow.

In order to have a better understanding of how to troubleshoot, let's gain some insight first:

- Resources are first created in the Kubernetes etcd database
- Use kubectl describe and kubectl events to see how that has been going
- After adding the resources to the database, the Pod application is started on the nodes where it is scheduled
- Before it can be started, the Pod image needs to be fetched
- Once the application is started, use kubectl logs to read the output of the application

-------------------------------

### Demo



Create the pod
```bash
kubectl run 112-pod --image=mysql
pod/112-pod created
```
&nbsp;

 Get the status of pods

```bash
kubectl get pods

NAME      READY   STATUS              RESTARTS      AGE
112-pod   0/1     ContainerCreating   0             11s
```
&nbsp;

What is going on in the pod?
As you can see in the events queue, it is pulling the image:

```bash
kubectl describe pod/112-pod
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From               Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----               -------
  Normal  Scheduled  20s   default-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/112-pod to talos-pmv-2qi
  Normal  Pulling    20s   kubelet            Pulling image "mysql"
```

&nbsp;

However, after a proper perior of time, the Pod did not come up:
```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME      READY   STATUS             RESTARTS      AGE
112-pod   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   2 (25s ago)   107s
```

&nbsp;


Let's investigate:
```bash
kubectl describe pods/112-pod

Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                 From               Message
  ----     ------     ----                ----               -------
  Normal   Scheduled  2m38s               default-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/112-pod to talos-pmv-2qi
  Normal   Pulled     2m14s               kubelet            Successfully pulled image "mysql" in 23.842s (23.842s including waiting). Image size: 241141026 bytes.
  Warning  BackOff    3s (x7 over 91s)    kubelet            Back-off restarting failed container 112-pod in pod 112-pod_default(f20c8115-fe75-4d80-a79a-61d0d22aa657)
```

 It appears that describe is not providing enough information about the status of this Pod that is not yet up & running.

&nbsp;


Let's try a different apporach:
```bash
kubectl logs pod/112-pod

2025-03-01 22:50:23+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Entrypoint script for MySQL Server 9.2.0-1.el9 started.
2025-03-01 22:50:23+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Switching to dedicated user 'mysql'
2025-03-01 22:50:23+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Entrypoint script for MySQL Server 9.2.0-1.el9 started.
2025-03-01 22:50:24+00:00 [ERROR] [Entrypoint]: Database is uninitialized and password option is not specified
    You need to specify one of the following as an environment variable:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
    - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD
    - MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

As it is now clear, there existed an issue with the initialization the DB requires to start smoothly.
