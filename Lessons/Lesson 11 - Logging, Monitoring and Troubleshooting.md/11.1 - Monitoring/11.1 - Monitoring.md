## 11.1 - Monitoring

To get a better understanding of the status of K8s Cluster, we have already revised commands such as "get" and "describe".

Also mentioned the [metric-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) in [Lesson 7.1](https://github.com/AlejandroSobral/CKA/blob/main/Lessons/Lesson%207%20-%20Node%20Maintenance/7.1%20-%20Monitoring/7.1%20-%20Kubernetes%20Monitoring.md).

Once the Metric Server is up and running, the "top" command can be used:


```bash
kubectl top nodes
NAME            CPU(cores)   CPU(%)      MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY(%)
talos-2pv-ytc   79m          2%          522Mi           3%
talos-9cm-iu6   228m         5%          1242Mi          9%
talos-pmv-2qi   125m         4%          514Mi           3%
talos-1p6-m7a   <unknown>    <unknown>   <unknown>       <unknown>

kubectl top pods
NAME      CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
mysapod   0m           1Mi
```

It is worth mentioning that a professional monitoring would include additional tool such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) + [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).
