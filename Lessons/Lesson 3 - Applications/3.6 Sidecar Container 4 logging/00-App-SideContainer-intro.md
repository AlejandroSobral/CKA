As a Pod should be created for each specific task, running single-container Pods is the standard.
In some cases, an additional container is needed to modify or present data generated by the main container
Specific use cases are defined:
- Sidecar: provides additional functionality to the main container
- Ambassador: is used as a proxy to connect containers externally
- Adapter: is used to standardize or normalize main container1 output
