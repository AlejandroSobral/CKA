## Static Pods

A static pod is a pod that is automatically picked by the kubelet. (Node Agent).

Kubelet is a systemd process configured to run static Pods from the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.
On the control node, static Pods are an essential part of how kubernetes works: systemd starts kubelet, and kubelet starts core Kubernetes services as static Pods.
Administrators can manually add static Pods if so desired, just copy a manifest file into the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory and the kubelet process will pick it up.

To modify the path where Kubelet picks up the static Pods, edit staticPodPath in /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml and use sudo systemctl restart kubelet to restart.
**Never do this on the control node!**

### Step by step guide

Get the base for the yaml, running the command in the **Control Node**:
``` bash
kubectl run staticpod --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml 
```


```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: staticpod
  name: staticpod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: staticpod
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

Check the existing Pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

This step should be executed in the **WORKER NODE**. 
Set the file into the manifest folder:

```bash
sudo cp staticpod.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ 
```


Check the existing Pods after the change:
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

Take the following output as example:

Before:
```bash
alesb@ControlNode:~$ kubectl get pods -o wide
