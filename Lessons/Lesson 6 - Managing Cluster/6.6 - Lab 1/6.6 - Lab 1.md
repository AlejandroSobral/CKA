## Lesson 6 Lab Running Static Pods

- On node workernode, run a static Pod with the name mypod, using an Nginx image and no further configuration.
- Use the appropriate tools to verify that the static Pod has started successfully.


---------------------------------------------------

## Solution

Check the Pods running:
```bash
kubectl get pods


alesb@ControlNode:~$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
```

&nbsp;

Prompt the YAML output for the static pod in the Control Node:

```bash
kubectl run staticpod --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml 
```
&nbsp;

Create a file based on the output of the YAML file:

**Check that I've changed the metadata.Name & containers.name to 'mypod'**

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: staticpod
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: mypod
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```
&nbsp;

Create a file name static-pod-lab6.yaml and place it at /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ on the **worker node**.

```bash
worker@WorkerNode2:~/Documents/temp$ nano static-pod-lab6.yaml
worker@WorkerNode2:~/Documents/temp$ sudo mv static-pod-lab6.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
```

&nbsp;

Check the existing Pod on the worker node using *crictl* as appropiate tool:
```bash
sudo crictl pods | grep mypod
97ac220e5bc0b       26 seconds ago      Ready               mypod-workernode2                          default             0                   (default)
```
&nbsp;



Check the Pods running:
```bash
kubectl get pods

alesb@ControlNode:~$ kubectl get pods
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
staticpod-workernode2   1/1     Running   0          6s
```
