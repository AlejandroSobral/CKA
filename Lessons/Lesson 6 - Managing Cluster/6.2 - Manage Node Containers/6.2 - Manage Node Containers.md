## Manage Node Containers

Besides the already known **journalctl**, there exist specific tools to manage nodes. 

A useful utility to manage node containers is crictl. So why would you want to use it? 
All pods are started as containers on the nodes, and crictl is a generic tool that communicates with the container runtime to get information about running containers. And as such, you can use it as a replacement for generic tools like Docker and Podman. So that means that for basic container management and investigation you don't need Docker and Podman, you just need crictl. To use it, you will need to set a runtime-endpoint and an image-endpoint. 


To set crictl properly, apply the following file:
```YAML
runtime-endpoint: unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
image-endpoint: unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
timeout: 10
debug: true
```
For setting it up:
```bash
sudo cp crictl.yaml /etc/
```

List containers, and check if working. No errors or warnings must appear as output:
```bash
sudo crictl ps
```

List Pods that have been scheduled on the node. It will provide different outputs, whether is ran in the master node or in any worker node.
```bash
sudo crictl pods
```

Inspect container configuration.
```bash
sudo crictl inspect <name-or-id> | less
```

Pull an images:
```bash
sudo crictl pull <imagename>
sudo crictl pull docker.io/library/mysql
```

List images:
```bash
sudo crictl images
```
